<p>
    This project is a weather application that uses a custom-built API to provide weather data and forecasts. The API has been designed to deliver accurate and up-to-date weather information. For more details about how to use the API, please refer to the section at the bottom of the README file.

<h3 align="left">About the project:</h3>
<p>
In this project, the following features have been implemented:

1. City Information Retrieval: Users can search for weather information by entering the city name.
2. User Location-Based Weather Reports: The application can access the user’s location to provide weather reports for their current area.
3. Error Handling with Modals: If a user enters an incorrect or nonexistent city name, a modal will open to inform the user of the error, displaying the specific issue.
4. 5-Day Weather Forecast: The application provides a 5-day weather forecast for the selected city, whether searched by city name or determined by the user’s location.

This project is developed using JavaScript.

<p>
Now, let’s talk about the API used in this weather application, which is developed with JavaScript. I utilized the free version of the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeatherMap API</a>, which provides current weather data and a 5-day forecast. This functionality is quite sufficient for our weather project.

To use this API, you need to sign up on their website and obtain an API key, which is required to access the API services.
